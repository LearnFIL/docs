# LearnFIL Documentation

This folder contains the core documentation for the LearnFIL project.

LearnFIL is a local-first, browser-based learning platform that is evolving into a distributed learning network using Filecoin onchain cloud primitives, libp2p networking, and Telegram and Discord bots.

The documentation is organized to reflect:
- What is already implemented
- What is currently in progress
- What is planned next
